# Vesting_Contract
This is a Vesting Contract

-> Here every user needs a manager to set up vesting streams
-> Manager has the access to manage the vesting streams
-> This contract does not include deposit of tokens from the user as the vesting stream is set up by the manager and we need separate function for that


I tried to include more test cases but was not able to as I was facing some problems. I tested the contract on the explorer and was working good. Need to make more test cases.
